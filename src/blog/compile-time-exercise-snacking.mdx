- Work(out).
- Stay active even during long working durations.
- Less boredom while waiting for compilation to finish.
- Less distraction (in comparison to e.g. checking the phone or social media).
- Automatic trigger for starting the exercise.
- Downside: Longer compile times become less of an issue, reducing motivation to reduce them.
- Need to find exercises that can be easily done in a short amount of time.
- Making it a habit makes it easier to do exercises every day.
- Only works under specific circumstances: Work from home (or elsewhere where it's fine to do exercises), can wear workout clothes, natural breaks of work as trigger (waiting for compilation).
- No need to plan extra time for workouts when they are just part of the work schedule.
- Standard progressive overload through increasing weight and/or reps.
- Additional sports are still encouraged of course (Mostly Volleyball for me and occasionally various other sports).
