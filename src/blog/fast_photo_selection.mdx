Occasionally I'm in the situation that I have lots of photos and I want to select the best ones. Be it for a photo book or just to share the photos with family and friends. Recently, I started optimizing this process more because I wanted to create a family photo book and had ~20,000 photos to chose from. Needless to say that making the selection process fast was essential. Every tenth of a second per photo results in half an hour more time overall.

My process changed a bit over time, but for that project I started using [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) and was quite happy with the speed. In this post, I want to briefly describe my current process. It's fairly straight forward overall but might still some getting used to.

### Step 1: Load images into darktable

Open darktable and use `Add to library` to select the images you want to select. For demonstration purposes I created a bunch of images with random colors.

### Step 2: Setup filter

By default, every image has a rating of one star for me. So my initial filter will be set to one star as well. This way all the images are visible initially.

After setting the filter, all images that have a different number of stars will be hidden automatically.

### Step 3: Full screen preview

Select the first image and click the full preview layout icon. Alternatively, hover over the first image and press `F`. To go back, press `F` again.

### Step 4: Use shortcuts to change image rating

Now a single image is visible at a time. The number of stars can be adjusted by pressing to corresponding number key. Additionally, `R` can be pressed to reject an image completely.

In this first stage, it's best to just do a very rough selection. For me that usually means rejecting everything that's out of focus or obviously not good for other reasons. In most cases, it takes less than a second to make this decision for any given image.

Specifically, I look at the image and press either `R` to reject or `2` to move the image into the next stage. In either case, the image will disappear because it does not match the filter anymore.

Undoing a mistake is possible with `ctrl+Z` or by temporarily changing the filter.

### Step 5: Improve selection

The previous step just did a very rough selection very quickly. I generally, do one or two more passes over the remaining images until I'm left with just the good ones. Here, I also tend to look more often at neighboring images, because often there are multiple very similar images which are all good. In this case, I just keep the best one.

The general process is to first change the filter to two stars now. Then, I use the `3` key to move good images further, or use `1` to move the images back down.

### Step 6: Further processing

What happens next depends on what further processing is done on the images. Generally, you can set the filter to the highest star count you have given the images. Then either keep processing them in darktable or copy all the selected images to a new folder.

To copy the chosen images to a new folder, first select all of them and then use the `Copy` operation. Note: this also makes darktable track the newly copied images. You'll need to select/import the original images again if you want to change the filters. The operation also copies the `.xmp` files which can just be deleted if you don't need them anymore.
